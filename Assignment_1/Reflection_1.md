# **Reflection - Visit to New Academia Learning Innovation (NALI 2023)**

#### In my first assignment, I wrote about my visit to New Academia Learning Innovation (NALI 2023) and learned a lot about how technology and education interact. The encounter offered a hands-on look at how technology may be used to improve our quality of life in practical situations. The Physical Education Augmented Reality (PEAR) software was one noteworthy innovation on display during the tour. This program uses image tracking and virtual models in real-world scenarios to support interactive learning for students with disabilities. Observing the use of augmented reality (AR) in the classroom enhanced my knowledge of the technology's revolutionary potential and demonstrated how it can make difficult subjects more interesting.

#### My team conducted interviews with inventors while we were there. But there were issues because our recording audio was not very clear, in part because the event emcee was making introductions at the same time. As I think about it, I realize how crucial it is to figure out how to guarantee better audio quality in subsequent recordings, such as getting presenters to wear mics or choosing quieter settings for the camera. This event taught us a lot about how to best set up the environment for efficient data collection.

#### Even though we had a setback when one of our team members was sick and couldn't join us, I am pleased with my team's perseverance. Despite this difficulty, we managed to record five interview sessions, exhibiting strong teamwork and perseverance in finishing our task.
