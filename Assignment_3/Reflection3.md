# **Reflection - Video on Visit to UTMDigital and the Attended Virtual Talk**
### I learned a lot about the most recent developments in ICT and technology, especially the Huawei IdealHub, from assignment 3, where we had to make a video for the industry visit to UTM Digital and the virtual discussion on "UTM Digital â€“ Our Digital University Driver." It was a pleasant experience to explore its features with my peers, and it demonstrated how these kinds of tools can greatly improve productivity. During the visit, we were also introduced to UTMsmart, which is an example of how technology simplifies academic tasks.
### I gained a fresh perspective and learned about the complexities of server maintenance by going into the UTM server room. The staff provided practical insights into guaranteeing server functioning with their thorough explanation, which included the installation of air conditioning at floor level to prevent interference from water vapor.
### As I think back on the process of making the video, I see how crucial theme consistency was for our team. It became clear that agreeing on a central concept is essential before breaking into individual segments. This view was brought about by the differences in our video's parts like our preferences in music which, when put together, produced a somewhat jumbled end product. To guarantee a smoother and more harmonious video presentation in the future, the group must effectively communicate to develop a cohesive concept. In summary, this work enhanced my understanding of technology and underscored the significance of cooperative planning in producing a unified final output.
