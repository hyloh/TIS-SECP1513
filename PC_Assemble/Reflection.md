# **Reflection - PC Assemble**
### I learned how to assemble and disassemble computers practically in the PC assembly lab. Understanding essential hardware elements including the CPU, RAM, and processor fan was the main goal. I was able to gain competence in wiring connections and setting up these parts through practical exercises. My PC assembly skills were improved by the lab experience, which also gave me invaluable troubleshooting and maintenance knowledge. All in all, the lab was a lively investigation of the complex components that make up a computer system, expanding my comprehension of its internal workings.
