# **Reflection - System Development @ Credence (TM Subsidiary)**
### In Assignment 4, I wrote a report on an industry talk titled "System Development @ Credence (TM Subsidiary)" which gave me insightful knowledge about the tools and technologies employed in the technology sector. The presenter offered insightful advice on grasping the complexities of system development, based on her experiences from internships. Her observations provide a useful viewpoint on what it takes to succeed in this fast-paced industry. However, the talk also highlighted areas that needed work. For example, it might be possible to improve the audio quality to guarantee that participant-question exchanges are clear. Furthermore, a lot of participants were taken aback by the sudden conclusion without an appropriate closure, indicating the need for more smooth transitions. Despite these drawbacks, the industry talk helped me learn more about system development and provided a look at how tools and technology are used in the real world.
